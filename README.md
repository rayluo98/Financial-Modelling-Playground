# Financial-Modelling-Playground

This repo used to be a collection of things that I had worked during my Master's program: a trading paper on oil futures calendar spread, a paper on barrier options pricing with non-constant strikes, and a genetic algorithm on optimal trading strategies. 

Now, I mainly focus on creating a quantitative trading system in the quant trading folder. The idea to this library is as follows: 
- Creating a systematic backtest framework for both single and multiple assets using an order book structure to keep track of trade execution
- Formalizing a space to create purely statistical/quantitative measures (as opposed to fundamental analysis) to create pairs trading signals
- TO BE DONE: Implementing a pipeline to combine and boost simple signals into more complicated ones.

While the baseline is quite simple, this library is implemented with the intention of scaling and incoporating more bespoke/complex models. Some future references may be made with respect to my other library on Options Pricing. A lot of work will be leverage on various forms of optimization.
